# dotfiles
Contains my personal dotfiles and the branches of any dotfiles I 
decide to borrow. Contributions are mentioned at the top of each file.

Currently I'm using iTerm, vim, tmux, and zsh for development.

# Installation
This repository can be cloned to wherever. Then just:
'''
cd my_dotfiles
./makesymlinks.sh
'''

After symlinks have been made go into vim and run Vundle with:
'''
:PluginInstall
'''
